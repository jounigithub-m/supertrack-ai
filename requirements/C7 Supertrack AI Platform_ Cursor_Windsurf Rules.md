## **C7 Supertrack AI Platform: Cursor/Windsurf Rules**

This document defines clear guidelines and rules for using Cursor.ai or Windsurf during AI-assisted coding workflows for the Supertrack AI Platform. The rules are designed to ensure consistency, minimize errors, and streamline the development process.

---

### **General Coding Guidelines**

* Clearly comment and document your code for readability.  
* Use meaningful naming conventions for files, variables, functions, and components.  
* Ensure strict adherence to the established frontend and backend guidelines documents.  
* Regularly commit small, functional increments of changes to the repository.

### **AI-Assisted Coding Workflow Rules**

* Always review AI-generated code thoroughly before committing.  
* When generating code using Cursor or Windsurf, include detailed, explicit prompts with clear requirements.  
* Limit each coding task to a well-defined, isolated functionality.  
* Do not combine multiple complex functionalities into a single AI prompt.

### **Avoiding AI Hallucinations**

* Explicitly state technologies, dependencies, and frameworks in your prompts.  
* Use reference documentation links within your prompts for complex functionalities.  
* Verify all external API endpoints and integrations generated by AI with official documentation.

### **Prompt Construction Rules**

* Begin prompts with clear instructions, specifying what type of file or functionality is required.  
* Clearly mention relevant technologies or libraries required.  
* Specify desired coding patterns, design principles, or best practices explicitly.

### **Verification and Testing**

* Run automated tests on generated code using Jest and React Testing Library.  
* Manually verify critical functionality and user interactions.  
* Perform frequent integration tests between frontend and backend.

### **Documentation Standards**

* Document generated functions, methods, and components immediately after verification.  
* Clearly label code sections generated by AI to facilitate easy debugging and maintenance.

### **Code Consistency**

* Maintain consistent use of code formatting (via Prettier) and linting rules (via ESLint).  
* Regularly perform codebase-wide reviews to maintain uniformity.
