---

### **Executive Summary**

Supertrack AI Platform is a multi-tenant SaaS solution transforming enterprise data into interactive, intelligent, and agent-driven knowledge ecosystems. Leveraging Apache Iceberg, StarRocks analytical databases, Neo4j knowledge graphs, and advanced RAG 2.0 technology, the platform enables personalized, high-accuracy agent interactions powered by enterprise data.

The platform provides three-tier personalization:

* **Tenant-Level:** Company-specific terminology and data context.  
* **User-Level:** Response personalization based on explicit/inferred user preferences.  
* **Product-Level:** Cross-tenant industry insights ensuring continuous learning and strict data isolation.

Built on Next.js 14.x, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui, the intuitive platform empowers administrators and users with robust interfaces for managing data sources, personalization, and agents. The initial frontend implementation will use the existing Supertrack AI Front End App built with Next.js 14.x, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and React Server Components. Development will continue using Cursor.ai to integrate frontend enhancements seamlessly with backend improvements, leveraging the "vibe coding" methodology for rapid iteration.
