## **A2 Supertrack AI Platform: Monitoring and Logging Setup**

This document provides instructions for setting up monitoring and logging systems using Azure Application Insights to ensure optimal operation and easy maintenance of the Supertrack AI Platform.

### **1\. Azure Application Insights Setup**

Create and configure Azure Application Insights:

* Navigate to Azure Portal and create an Application Insights resource.  
* Connect Application Insights to all backend services.  
* Enable continuous integration of logs from Azure Durable Functions and Container Apps.

### **2\. Monitoring Dashboards**

Design real-time monitoring dashboards within Azure:

* System health overview dashboard  
* Backend service performance metrics  
* Frontend responsiveness and loading performance

### **2\. Logging Configuration**

Establish logging protocols:

* Set logging levels (error, warning, info, debug) appropriately for each service.  
* Implement centralized logging through Application Insights.  
* Configure structured logging to facilitate debugging and analysis.

### **3\. Alerts and Notifications**

Set up automated alerts:

* Define critical system performance thresholds.  
* Configure real-time email and SMS alerts for administrators.  
* Implement proactive alert rules for resource usage and service anomalies.

### **4\. Performance Analysis**

Implement dashboards to monitor:

* API latency and throughput  
* Database performance metrics (Cosmos DB, Neo4j, StarRocks)  
* Cache efficiency (Redis)

### **3\. Real-time Health Monitoring**

Enable real-time health dashboards:

* Set up system availability and error rate tracking.  
* Configure alerts for abnormal conditions or service interruptions.

### **4\. Alert and Notification System**

Configure alerts and notifications:

* Setup Azure alerts for critical system events.  
* Integrate alerts with email or messaging platforms for immediate notification.

### **4\. Continuous Improvement**

Leverage monitoring data:

* Regularly review performance data.  
* Identify bottlenecks and optimize system performance.  
* Update logging and monitoring strategies based on new insights.
