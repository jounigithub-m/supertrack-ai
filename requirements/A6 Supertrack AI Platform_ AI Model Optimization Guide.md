## **A6 Supertrack AI Platform: AI Model Optimization Guide**

This guide provides detailed instructions and best practices for optimizing AI models used within the Supertrack AI Platform.

---

### **1\. Embedding Optimization**

#### **Embedding Techniques**

* Choose optimal embedding dimensions balancing accuracy and memory usage.  
* Regularly retrain embeddings with new tenant-specific data.

#### **Vector Indexing**

* Optimize vector indexing parameters (HNSW indexing) to ensure efficient retrieval.  
* Periodically re-tune indexing parameters based on retrieval performance analytics.

### **2\. Model Quantization**

* Utilize ONNX Runtime quantization methods to reduce model size and latency.  
* Regularly verify model accuracy post-quantization to ensure performance remains optimal.

### **3\. Fine-Tuning LLaMA 7B Models**

#### **Fine-Tuning Process**

* Identify and prepare tenant-specific data for fine-tuning.  
* Perform distributed fine-tuning using Azure Machine Learning for efficiency.

### **4\. Semantic Caching**

* Configure Redis caching for frequently accessed embeddings and responses.  
* Define semantic caching strategies clearly to maximize performance and minimize redundant computations.

### **4\. Continuous Model Improvement**

* Set up continuous training pipelines leveraging real-time user feedback and platform usage data.  
* Regularly analyze feedback and retrain models using preference optimization techniques (KTO, APO, CLARE).

### **5\. ONNX Runtime Management**

* Regularly monitor ONNX model runtime performance and resource consumption.  
* Optimize backend infrastructure based on runtime analytics and usage patterns.
