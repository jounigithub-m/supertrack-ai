## **A7 Supertrack AI Platform: Continuous Integration & Delivery (CI/CD) Setup**

This document describes the procedures and best practices for setting up Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines using Azure DevOps for the Supertrack AI Platform.

---

### **1\. Azure DevOps Project Setup**

* Set up an Azure DevOps organization and project.  
* Define repositories for frontend and backend codebases.  
* Configure secure access control and permissions.

### **2\. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration**

#### **Pipeline Setup**

* Create CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps.  
* Define pipeline YAML files clearly for easy version control and transparency.

### **3\. Continuous Integration**

* Automate testing for code quality and functionality using Jest and React Testing Library.  
* Set up automated linting and formatting checks (ESLint, Prettier).  
* Enable automatic build and verification on code commits.

### **4\. Continuous Delivery**

* Configure automatic deployment of frontend and backend services to Azure Container Apps.  
* Automate deployment processes including environment variable configuration.  
* Establish secure and automated secret management within Azure Key Vault.

### **4\. Deployment Environments**

* Configure dedicated development, staging, and production environments.  
* Automate provisioning and teardown of environments via Azure DevOps.

### **5\. Automated Testing**

* Implement automated unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.  
* Integrate test results into the CI/CD pipeline for immediate feedback.

### **6\. Rollback Strategies**

* Clearly document rollback procedures.  
* Automate rollback processes in case deployment or testing fails.

### **6\. Continuous Deployment**

* Set triggers for automatic deployment to production upon successful test completion in staging.  
* Monitor deployments closely and implement approval gates for production deployments.

### **6\. Monitoring and Alerts**

* Integrate Azure Application Insights with Azure DevOps pipelines.  
* Set up automated alerts for build failures, test failures, or deployment issues.
